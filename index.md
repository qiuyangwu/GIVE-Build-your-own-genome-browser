GIVE  is an open source programming library that allows anyone with HTML programming experience to build custom genome browser websites or apps.  With a few lines of codes, one can add to a personal webpage an interactive genome browser that host custom data. It typically takes less than half a day to build a genome browser website with GIVE. 
This portable library encapsulates novel data communication and data visualization technologies, including new data structures and new memory management methods that enable efficient data transfer between the data-hosting website and internet browsers.  
GIVE is the acronym of **G**enomic **I**nteraction **V**isualization **E**ngine, although GIVE's utilities have outgrown its original name.
